# SurvivalLearningGame
game made in godot based around the premise of learning things by doing and advancing through human history. will attempt to contain extremely complex progression through various ages, from neolithic to information. One will be forced to
continuously develop new technology in order to keep monsters at bay which arrive in waves to attack your base. they will get stronger, and so you will require greater and greater technology to fend them off. will support co-op and singleplayer.

below is a to-do/roadmap for what I would consider the first alpha release.  

# completed
- basic movement
- basic attack function

# to-do
### immediate to-do
- implement inventory
- add some attack animation so you dont need to watch console
- placing things
### long term to-do
- **multiplayer**
- implement multi hit
- npc's
- workbenches

### vague ideas
npc teaching
enemy wave spawning
- map generation?
- caves??
- **basic neolithic age**
